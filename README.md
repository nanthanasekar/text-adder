# Swipable Portrait Images with Editable Text

## Overview
This project showcases a web page that allows users to view swipable portrait images with editable text overlays. It features various controls for customizing the text's appearance, including color, font family, font size, and line height. Additionally, users can apply bold and italic styles and trigger an animation effect on the text.

## Features
- **Swipable Image Gallery**: Users can navigate through portrait images using next/previous buttons.
- **Editable Text Overlay**: Add text to each image and modify its properties in real-time.
- **Customizable Controls**:
  - Change text color.
  - Select font family.
  - Adjust font size and line height.
  - Toggle bold and italic styles.
- **Animation**: Apply a fade-in slide animation to the text overlay.
- **Instructional Message**: A helpful message appears when an animation is triggered.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic interactivity.
- **Swiper.js** for the image carousel.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone or download the project repository.**
2. **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.**
3. **Interact with the interface**:
   - Use the "Add Text" button to place editable text on the images.
   - Customize the text using color pickers, font selectors, and input fields.
   - Apply bold or italic styles with respective buttons.
   - Click "Animate" to apply an animation effect.

## How It Works
- **Image Navigation**: Utilizes Swiper.js for creating a responsive carousel.
- **Text Editing**: Text elements are added dynamically and styled with user inputs.
- **Animations**: CSS keyframes create a fade-in effect with a sliding motion.

## Customization
To modify the design or functionality, you can adjust the following:
- **CSS**: Update styles within the `<style>` section or create a separate CSS file.
- **JavaScript**: Edit functions to include more interactivity or adjust existing behavior.

## Notes
- The project does not include a backend or database support; it's a client-side implementation.
- For cross-browser compatibility, test with major browsers to ensure styling and functionality are consistent.
